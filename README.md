<h1 align="center">Hi there 👋, I'm Oséias Mozdzen</h1>
- 👨🏽‍💻 I am a Backend developer

#### I have experience in several languages and technologies, with a special focus on:
🐍 Python: I am experienced in web development with FastAPI and Flask, and have worked on automation and data analysis projects with Python.

👋 GO: I am currently engaged in learning GO and exploring the possibilities of this powerful and efficient language for creating systems and APIs.

🐋 Docker: I'm learning more about this 'sea' of possibilities (laughs) by writing many Dockerfiles and running numerous images.
